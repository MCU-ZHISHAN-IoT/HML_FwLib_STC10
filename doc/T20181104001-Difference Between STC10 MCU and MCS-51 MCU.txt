============================================================

STC10 series MCU is a kind of micro-controller, which based on Intel MCS-51 MCU, released by STC Micro(宏晶), China. And there are following difference between them.

1. [GPIO] Add the push-pull mode, the open-drain mode and the high-impedance mode for the GPIO ports; Add the P4 GPIO port.

2. [IAP] Add the IAP module. In fact, it's a on-chip EEPROM which can be accessed by user freely. Besides, it can be configured as the entry point of the program.

3. [MEM] Add an expansion memory which is physically embedded on the same chips with MCU while logically independent with MCU. It can be enabled through calling the MEM_cmd_internalExtendedRam function.

4. [Power] Low voltage detection pin is added in STC10 MCUs. Besides, an interruption(LVD) will be raised when input voltage of the pin is under the threshold.

5. [Power] Implement the POF bit in the PCON register. Add the power down mode and idle mode, user can save power consumption by these modes.

6. [RCC] It's not necessary to make sure to provide extern clock source, because of internal RC clock; the programmable division factor and the MCO module.

7. [RCC] Add the software reset function. The programs can reset the MCU by resetting the corresponding register flag bit.

8. [Timer] No timer-2.

9. [UART] Add the independent baud rate generator(BRT) for the UART; Add the 1T/12T mode for the UART.

10. [Watchdog] Add the watchdog module.
